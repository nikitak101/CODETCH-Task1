Overview of the Project

 Project: SIMPLE CALCULATOR
 
  Objectives of the Project:
1. Learn and Demonstrate Programming Basics:
   - Introduce foundational programming concepts like input/output, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations.
2. Develop Problem-Solving Skills:
   - Encourage logical thinking through the design and implementation of a functional calculator.
3. User Interaction:
   - Create a user-friendly interface to interact with the program.
4. Error Handling:
   - Provide mechanisms to handle invalid user inputs gracefully.

Key Activities of the Project:
1. Requirement Analysis:
   - Define the scope of the calculator, including supported operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Design:
   - Plan the program structure, including input prompts, operation selection, and result display.
3.Implementation:
   - Write Python code for:
     - Taking user input.
     - Performing selected operations.
     - Handling errors (e.g., invalid inputs, division by zero).
4. Testing:
   - Test the program with various inputs to ensure accuracy and robustness.
   - Verify proper error handling (e.g., invalid operation selection or non-numeric inputs).
5.Documentation:
   - Document code with comments for clarity.
   - Create a brief user guide explaining program usage.
6. Iteration:
   - Refine the program based on testing feedback (e.g., adding a loop for continuous use).

Technologies Used:
1. Programming Language: 
   - Python: For its simplicity and readability, making it ideal for beginners.
2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   - VS Code for writing and testing the program.
3. Standard Libraries:
   - Built-in Python functions like `input()`, `print()`, and exception handling (`try-except`) for error management.
